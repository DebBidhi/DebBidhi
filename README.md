## About Me

I'm a **machine learning engineer** with roots in physics who transitioned into building intelligent systems. Founded **ApexKrieg**, where I developed AI-powered productivity tools using LLMs and data-driven insights. I thrive in **startup environments**, working closely with teams to ship products that solve real problems - from designing scalable architectures to collaborating with stakeholders and turning ideas into production-ready solutions.

## 🛠️ What I Build

### Full-Stack Development
Create dynamic **React** frontends and scalable **Node.js** backends with microservices. Experienced in **API design**, **containerization**, **monitoring**, and **automated deployment** pipelines for reliable systems.

### Machine Learning & AI
Develop **agents** using **LLMs** and **AI workflows**. Implement **retrieval-augmented generation**, **model fine-tuning**, and manage **deep learning** pipelines from research to production.

### Product-First Approach
Transform ideas into shipped products: **prototype** → **iterate** → **scale**. Focus on user impact, technical excellence, and building solutions that matter in fast-moving environments.

## 🌱 When I'm Not Coding

- Anime & Sci-fi 📺
- Evolutionary biology 🧬
- Neuroscience 🧠
- Geopolitics & history 🌍
